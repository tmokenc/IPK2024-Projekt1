# Limitation
- In the UDP variant, if the last packet has not been confirmed, all incoming packets that are not of type CONFIRM are completely ignored, even if they have been successfully delivered. It is expected that the server should send CONFIRM on the last payload first. After a few retransmissions following CONFIRM, the message should arrive. However, in rare cases, subsequent retransmissions may be lost, causing the server to send an ERR message and the client to terminate the program. This can be confusing for the user.
- Not all errors are handled properly.
